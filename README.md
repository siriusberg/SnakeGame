# Snake Game 
This Snake Game is a simple implementation using the Pygame library. It allows players to control a snake and collect food to grow longer. The game continues until the snake collides with the screen boundaries or itself.

## Requirements
To play and modify the Snake Game, you need to have the Pygame library installed. <br>
You can install it using the following command: `pip install pygame`

## Usage
1. Run the Snake Game script using the following command: `python Snake.py`
2. Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to control the snake's movement:
   - <b>Left Arrow / A</b>: Move left
   - <b>Right Arrow / D</b>: Move right
   - <b>Up Arrow / W</b>: Move up
   - <b>Down Arrow / S</b>: Move down
3. The snake's goal is to eat the green food on the screen, which increases its length.
4. The game ends if:
   - The snake collides with the screen boundaries.
   - The snake collides with itself.


## Features
- Snake movement controlled by arrow keys or WASD.
- Food spawns randomly on the screen.
- Score display showing the length of the snake.
- Game over message and option to play again.

## Future Enhancements
We're always looking to improve our Snake Game. Some potential enhancements include:

- Adding levels with increasing difficulty.
- Implementing different game modes.
- Introducing special power-ups and obstacles.
